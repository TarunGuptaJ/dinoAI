## Observations
* By the 5th generation the dinosaur had figured out from what distance it has to jump to cross the obstacle.
* By the 11th generation the dinosaur had figured out to jump much earlier to cross multiple obstacle one after the other.

The Weights of the 11th Gen dinosaur has been saved in the ```Dino11thGen.json``` file.
